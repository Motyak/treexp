All POSIX programs have their own definition of a line, that differs from
the one we see in a text editor and ourself.

POSIX considers a line as a sequence of characters that ends with
a new line.

So if a file only has 1 line, with no empty new line at the end, then
it won't be considered as a line. So programs such as wc, cat, echo or sed
won't work as expected and we will have to manually add/remove the extra newline.

Problem :
echo prints variables that doesn't end with a trailing newline with a trailing newline
BUT
prints variables that contains a trailing newline WITHOUT the additional trailing newline

To solve this issue:
1) We add an extra \n if the string already ends with one
2) We echo the variable between " and add \c at the end of it
